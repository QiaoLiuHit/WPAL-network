# Weakly-supervised Pedestrian Attribute Localization Network

By Ken Yu, under guidance of Dr. Zhang Zhang and Prof. Kaiqi Huang.

Weakly-supervised Pedestrian Attribute Localization Network (WPAL-network) is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structure designed for recognizing attributes from objects as well as localizing them. Currently it is developed to recognize attributes from pedestrians only, using the Richly Annotated Pedestrian (RAP) database or PETA database.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository

    ```Shell
    # Make sure to clone with --recursive
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/kyu-sz/Weakly-supervised-Pedestrian-Attribute-Localization-Network.git
    ```

2. Build Caffe and pycaffe

	This project use python layers for input, etc. When building Caffe, set the WITH_PYTHON_LAYER option to true.

    ```Shell
    WITH_PYTHON_LAYER=1 make all pycaffe -j 8
    ```

3. Download the RAP database

    To get the Richly Annotated Pedestrian (RAP) database, please visit rap.idealtest.org to learn about how to download a copy of it.

    It should have two zip files.

    ```
    $RAP/RAP_annotation.zip
    $RAP/RAP_dataset.zip
    ```

4. Unzip them both to the directory.

    ```Shell
    cd $RAP
    unzip RAP_annotation.zip
    unzip RAP_dataset.zip
    ```

5. Create symlinks for the RAP database

    ```Shell
    cd $WPAL_NET_ROOT/data/dataset/
    ln -s $RAP RAP
    ```

## Usage

To train the model, first fetch a pretrained VGG_CNN_S model by:
	
```Shell
./data/scripts/fetch_pretrained_vgg_cnn_s_model.sh
```

Then run experiment script for training:

```Shell
./experiments/example/VGG_CNN_S/train_vgg_s_rap_0.sh
```

Experiment script for testing is also available:

```Shell
./experiments/examples/VGG_CNN_S/test_vgg_s_rap.sh
```
